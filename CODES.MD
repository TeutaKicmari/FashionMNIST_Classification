CNNClassifier_FashionMNIST.py:

1. Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow Keras

2. Purpose: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. The script handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, displaying the confusion matrix and classification report.

MLPClassifier_FashionMNIST.py:

1. Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow Keras

2. Purpose: Implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to serve as a baseline comparison for the CNN model. It processes images from the Fashion MNIST dataset by flattening them into vectors and classifying them using dense layers. This file covers the model's setup, training, performance evaluation, and visualization of results.

RelaLifeApplication_CNN.py

1. Libraries Used: PIL, Matplotlib, Numpy, TensorFlow Keras

2. Purpose: Demonstrates a real-life application of the trained CNN model to classify clothing items in a retail setting. This script processes real-world images, adapts them to the input format of the CNN, and visualizes predictions next to original images to showcase practical deployment capabilities.
