Fashion MNIST is a modern dataset designed to replace the traditional MNIST dataset, which has been a benchmark in the field of machine learning for years. Developed as an alternative to the original MNIST's handwritten digits, the Fashion MNIST dataset comprises grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 different categories, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a standardized frame for analyzing and comparing machine learning models.

The dataset's 10 categories include T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. This diversification introduces more complexity compared to the relatively simple digits of MNIST, making it a more challenging and relevant dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms today.
