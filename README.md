# FashionMNIST_Classification
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques in the fashion industry using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which comprises 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of various clothing items at 28x28 pixels. Two algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are built and compared to classify these fashion items into ten categories. The CNN model, known for handling spatial data through convolutional layers, serves as the primary algorithm, while the MLP model provides a comparative baseline. This repository includes all relevant code files, datasets, and documentation needed to reproduce and understand the model's training and application.
